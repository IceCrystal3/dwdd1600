        <h1>Running History</h1>
            
            <h2>Ancient Greece Running</h2>
            <p>In Ancient Greece, the history of running can be <strong>traced back to 776 BC.</strong> Running was important to members of ancient Greek society, and is consistently highlighted in documents referencing the Ancient Olympic Games</p>
            <p>Though foot races were <a href="benefits.html#physical">physically</a> challenging, if successful, athletes could become very wealthy. The ancient Greeks developed running as a sport into a <em>sophisticated field</em> of <a href="benefits.html#scientific">science</a> and philosophy.</p>
            <h2>Types of Footraces</h2>
            <p>There were many lengths and types of foot races in ancient Greece.</p>

            </dl>
        <h2>Training</h2>
            <p> Athletics in ancient Greece became a very scientific and philosophical field of study and practice. Many philosophers had their own ideas about how athletes should train.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Day One – the day of preparations. It consisted of toning and short, high-intensity workouts.</li>
                <li>Day Two – the day of intensity. It involved the athlete going through long, strenuous exercises.</li>
                <li>Day Three – the day of resting. On this day athletes would do short mild workouts and primarily rest.</li>
                <li>Day Four – the day of medium intensity. Athletes mainly practiced wrestling on this day, focusing more on tactics than strength.
